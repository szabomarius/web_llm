To build the user requirements
* Search codebase to understand requirements and existing patterns/conventions
* Plan changes and identify all affected files - consider dependencies and side effects
* Validate approach against project architecture before implementing
* Implement incrementally with working checkpoints - each step should be functional
* Add necessary imports, dependencies, and error handling throughout
* Test core functionality immediately after each major change
* Verify integration with existing codebase and ensure no regressions
* Create beautiful, modern UI with good UX if building interfaces
* Document any new patterns or significant architectural decisions
