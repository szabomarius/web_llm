Based on user provided bug report systematically diagnose:
* Search codebase and read error logs/recent changes first - understand current state
* Identify root cause vs symptoms - trace the actual failure path, not assumptions
* Validate proposed fix against similar patterns in codebase
* Test fix in isolation before applying - ensure no side effects
* Verify solution resolves original issue and doesn't break existing functionality
* Document what was actually broken and why the fix works
* If still uncertain, gather more context before proceeding
