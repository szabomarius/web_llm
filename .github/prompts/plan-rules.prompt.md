Use these rules when planning only
<Planning>
- plans are stored under .ai-context/tasks.md
- you plan in concise actionable steps
- your plans don't contain concrete details just the solutions aspect
- always think about plans that they'll be then handled by a junior-mid level engineer
- plans should be broken down into actionable and concrete steps which result in micro git commits
- never edit code when in planning mode
- always incorporate decisions in your planning
- when planning you should use the lense of an expert software engineer which has best practices in mind
- when thinking about packages and tools, use context7 to get up to date documentation before laying out the planning details
