Use these rules when creating code
<Work>
- ALWAYS use context7 tool when using a package or tool to have up to date
- check the internet before using a package or tool if it's the best way to do it
- have code quality and standards as your standard candles when building codes
- the user is a senior software engineer
- always work in micro commitable steps
- never overwhelm the user with too many batched changes at once
- think about tasks as commitable steps, small is good
- all work you do has a reason and value and can be backtracked to a purpose
